My father was a de-liverer, and his father before that.
They said that the machines would put us de-liverers out of business, but I've really benefited from mine.
I don't have a medical license or anything, if you thought that was the case.
De-livering isn't a particularly well-paying job, but it sure is rewarding.
I'm not really sure who this person is, or why his liver needs to be removed.
Don't ask me where the livers go once they've been removed -- I'm just the de-livering guy.
One would think that you need a liver to survive, but here we are.
Is this guy dead?
I don't think I've ever asked why exactly I'm doing this before.
Each successfully removed liver nets me a cool sum.
Things just haven't been the same since the Great Robo-War of 2049.
I wonder what I'm going to have for dinner. Probably rat meat. That's what I always have.
I wouldn't describe this world as a "utopia".
I should clean up all of these scalpels and scissors.
I need to clean the blades on some of these scalpels.
I hardly even use the scissors anymore, not after I got this grabber-machine.
Someday I want to buy a house out in the suburbs and get away from this busy urban life.
I think it might be acid-raining outside. 
I need to think of a good holiday gift for my mother.
The art of de-livering has really come a long way in the last 30 years.
I might need to buy more saline. I think we're running out.
What time is it? I've lost track.
I'm going to need to oil the grabber-hands after this.
It ain't much, but it's honest work.
There aren't many de-liverers in this neighborhood anymore, but I'll keep it up for as long as I need to.
Yes, I think I would consider myself an "essential worker."
Can't wait for the weekend.
One day, I might be the one cut open under the grabber-hands. What a thought.
Some people say what I do isn't a job, but that's offensive to us de-liverers.
I pay taxes like everyone else.
This damp alleyway isn't pretty, but hey, it's home.
